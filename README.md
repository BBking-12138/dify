![](./images/models.png)

**1. LLM Support**: Integration with OpenAI's GPT family of models, or the open-source Llama2 family models. In fact, Dify supports mainstream commercial models and open-source models (locally deployed or based on MaaS).

**2. Prompt IDE**: Visual orchestration of applications and services based on LLMs with your team.

**3. RAG Engine**: Includes various RAG capabilities based on full-text indexing or vector database embeddings, allowing direct upload of PDFs, TXTs, and other text formats.

**4. AI Agent**: Based on Function Calling and ReAct, the Agent inference framework allows users to customize tools, what you see is what you get. Dify provides more than a dozen built-in tool calling capabilities, such as Google Search, DELLÂ·E, Stable Diffusion, WolframAlpha, etc.


**5. Continuous Operations**: Monitor and analyze application logs and performance, continuously improving Prompts, datasets, or models using production data.

```bash
cd docker
docker compose up -d
```

After running, you can access the Dify dashboard in your browser at [http://localhost/install](http://localhost/install) and start the initialization installation process.

### Helm Chart

Big thanks to @BorisPolonsky for providing us with a [Helm Chart](https://helm.sh/) version, which allows Dify to be deployed on Kubernetes.
You can go to https://github.com/BorisPolonsky/dify-helm for deployment information.

### Configuration

If you need to customize the configuration, please refer to the comments in our [docker-compose.yml](docker/docker-compose.yaml) file and manually set the environment configuration. After making the changes, please run `docker-compose up -d` again.
