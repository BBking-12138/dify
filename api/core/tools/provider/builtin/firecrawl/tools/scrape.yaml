  llm: This utility initiates a web scraping process to harvest data from a designated URL. It facilitates customization of scraping preferences, including the option to include or exclude specific URL patterns, enhance image alt text generation leveraging advanced LLM technology (available with a premium plan), impose a limit on the maximum pages to scrape, and extract solely the primary content of each webpage. Depending on your preferences, the tool is capable of delivering either an inventory of scraped documents or a compilation of URLs.
